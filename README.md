# NYT-Spelling-Bee-Word-Finder
#This program let's you find possible words for the NYT Spelling Bee, which can be found at: https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee \
#Simply input the letters from that day (center letter at the end) and it will output a list of possible, high-scoring words. \
#Note that some words are not in the NYT word list - just try a few until you get one. \
#Rule of thumb: If you have never heard of that word, it's probably not in the NYT word list.
