# NYT-Spelling-Bee-Word-Finder
#This program let's you find all possible words for the NYT Spelling Bee (https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) \
#Simply input the letters from that day (center letter at the end) and it will output a list of all possible words \
#Note that some words are not in the NYT word list - just try a few until you get one. \
#The rule is: If you have never heard of that word, it's probably not in the NYT word list
